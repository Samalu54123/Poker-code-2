# Bank Management System (Java)

This is a Java-based Bank Management System project developed as part of an academic assessment. The system includes core banking operations and uses a local database for storing user and card data. It appears to be built using Apache NetBeans and Apache Derby (Java DB) as the embedded database.

## Features

- Account management via `User_database.txt`
- Card data tracking through `Cards.txt`
- Local embedded database setup (`BankDB`, `derby.properties`, `derby.log`)
- Organized modular structure with source files in `src/jta/assesment`
- Libraries and dependencies managed under `/lib`
- Sample data or templates stored under `/sample`
- Java build automation via `build.xml` (likely Ant)

## Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Apache NetBeans (recommended for easy setup)
- Apache Derby (Java DB) or compatible embedded DB
- Apache Ant (if building via `build.xml`)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samalu45/[REPO_NAME].git
Open with NetBeans or any Java IDE.

Ensure the Derby database is set up or accessible.

Build and run the project.

Notes
This project uses plain text files for some forms of persistent storage.

There is no description of user interface—assumed to be a CLI or simple GUI.

No external packages appear to be published.
