# Bank Management System (Java)

This is a Java-based Bank Management System project developed as part of an academic assessment. The system includes core banking operations and uses a local database for storing user and card data. It appears to be built using Apache NetBeans and Apache Derby (Java DB) as the embedded database.

## Features

- Account management via `User_database.txt`
- Card data tracking through `Cards.txt`
- Local embedded database setup (`BankDB`, `derby.properties`, `derby.log`)
- Organized modular structure with source files in `src/jta/assesment`
- Libraries and dependencies managed under `/lib`
- Sample data or templates stored under `/sample`
- Java build automation via `build.xml` (likely Ant)
